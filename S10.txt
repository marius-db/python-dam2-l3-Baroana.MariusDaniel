keyword_extraction.py:

-- 1
i need you to make me a code file that does the following:
Keyword Extraction – spaCy + NLTK
For example:
Top 5 most frequent words (NLTK)

Relevant nouns (spaCy)

Main verbs

-- 2 
make the code in spanish and make sure you don't use anything complicated and only the imports i told you 
to use and make it easy to read and not too long either. also take care of possible errors and comment it 
where you seem fit

-- 3
now take care of the errors and make sure to add comments explaining how this code works 
everywhere you see fit so if someone asks me anything about it no matter what part it is i 
can explain it easily
